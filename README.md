Cloud Foundry Autoscaler
========================

This project demonstrates the autoscaling of worker processes in a tradtional producer-consumer setting using RabbitMQ as the message queue. Workers are artifically throttled to create a queuing scenario.

NOTE: These projects require the as-of-yet unreleased spring-cloud library.
